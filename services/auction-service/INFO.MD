# Auction Service

The Auction Service is responsible for creating, listing, and managing auctions and bids on Ebaazee.  
It provides REST APIs to create auctions, fetch auction details, place bids, and track auction status.  
Real-time updates are delivered via WebSocket (Socket.IO) so all users can see live bids and auction changes.
