#  Start all services
./run-all.sh
# Or: docker compose up --build

#  Start specific services
docker compose up user-service auction-service payment-service

#  View logs (all services)
docker compose logs -f

#  View logs (specific service)
docker compose logs -f user-service

#  Check running containers
docker compose ps

#  Stop all services
docker compose down

#  Stop and remove volumes (deletes all data)
docker compose down -v

#  Restart a service
docker compose restart user-service

# Rebuild specific service

```

---

### Service Health Monitoring

```bash
# Check all services health
docker compose ps

#  View resource usage
docker stats

# Access OpenSearch Dashboards
open http://localhost:5601

# Access RabbitMQ Management UI
open http://localhost:15672
# Default credentials: guest/guest

#  Access Envoy Admin Interface
open http://localhost:9901

#  Check logs in OpenSearch
# 1. Go to http://localhost:5601
# 2. Navigate to "Discover"
# 3. Create index pattern: fluent-bit-*
# 4. Filter by kubernetes.container_name or log_level

#  Monitor RabbitMQ Queues
# 1. Go to http://localhost:15672
# 2. Login with guest/guest
# 3. Navigate to "Queues" tab
# 4. Check: payment-service-consumer, notification-queue
```

---

##  Troubleshooting

### Issue: Services won't start

```bash
# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs <service-name>

# Common fixes:
# 1. Restart the service
docker compose restart <service-name>

# 2. Rebuild the image
docker compose up --build <service-name>

# 3. Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :<port-number>
kill -9 <PID>

# 4. Clean Docker cache
docker system prune -a
```

---

### Issue: Database connection failures

```bash
# Check if databases are running
docker compose ps auth-db auction-db wallet-db

# View database logs
docker compose logs auth-db

# Restart databases
docker compose restart auth-db auction-db wallet-db

# Verify database is accepting connections
docker exec -it <db-container> psql -U <username> -d <database>
```

---

### Issue: RabbitMQ connection errors

```bash
# Restart RabbitMQ
docker compose restart rabbitmq

# Check RabbitMQ logs
docker compose logs rabbitmq

# Wait 30-60 seconds after startup for RabbitMQ to fully initialize

# Verify RabbitMQ is ready
curl http://localhost:15672/api/overview
# Login: guest/guest
```

---

### Issue: Port already in use

```bash
# Find process using port
lsof -i :8080

# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change port in docker-compose.yml
# ports:
#   - "8090:8080"  # Use 8090 instead
```

---

### Issue: Out of memory errors

```bash
# Check Docker memory allocation
docker stats

# Increase Docker memory:
# Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory: 8GB+

# Or reduce running services:
docker compose up envoy user-service auction-service payment-service

# Stop unused services:
docker compose stop notification-service analytics-service
```

---

### Issue: Builds failing (Java services)

```bash
# Common Maven issues:

# 1. Clear Maven cache in container
docker compose down
docker volume prune

# 2. Check JDK version in pom.xml
# Should be: <java.version>21</java.version>

# 3. Build locally to verify
cd services/user-service
./mvnw clean package

# 4. Ensure Docker can pull Maven image
docker pull maven:3.9.4-eclipse-temurin-21
```

---

### Issue: Payment service fails to build

```bash
# TypeScript compilation issues:

# 1. Install dependencies locally
cd services/payment-service
npm install
# Or: pnpm install

# 2. Verify tsconfig.json exists
cat tsconfig.json

# 3. Build locally to test
npm run build

# 4. Ensure Dockerfile installs dev dependencies
# Should have: RUN npm install (not npm install --production)
```

---

### Issue: Email notifications not sending

```bash
# Configure SMTP credentials:

# 1. Create .env file in project root
cat > .env << EOF
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
EOF

# 2. For Gmail, create an App Password:
# https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

# 3. Restart notification service
docker compose restart notification-service

# 4. Check logs
docker compose logs -f notification-service
```

---

### Issue: OpenSearch not starting

```bash
# Common OpenSearch issues:

# 1. Increase vm.max_map_count (Linux/macOS)
sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

# 2. Make it permanent
echo 'vm.max_map_count=262144' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

# 3. Restart OpenSearch
docker compose restart opensearch-node1 opensearch-node2

# 4. Check OpenSearch logs
docker compose logs opensearch-node1

# 5. Verify OpenSearch is up
curl http://localhost:9200
```

## Security Best Practices

### Production Deployment Checklist

#### Authentication & Authorization

### Code Style

#### Java Services
- Follow [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- Use Lombok annotations (@Data, @Builder, etc.)
- Document public APIs with Javadoc
- Keep methods under 50 lines
- Use meaningful variable names

```java
// Good
@Data
@Builder
public class UserDto {
    private Long id;
    private String email;
    private String name;
}

// Bad
public class UserDto {
    public Long i;
    public String e, n;
}
```

#### Node.js/TypeScript
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Use async/await (avoid callbacks)
- Use ES modules (import/export)
- Document functions with JSDoc

```typescript
// Good
export async function getUserById(id: string): Promise<User> {
    const user = await db.findUser(id);
    if (!user) throw new NotFoundException();
    return user;
}

// Bad
exports.getUser = function(id, callback) {
    db.findUser(id, function(err, user) {
        callback(err, user);
    });
};
```

#### Go Service
- Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
- Use `gofmt` for formatting
- Use meaningful package names
- Handle errors explicitly

```go
// Good
func sendEmail(to string, subject string, body string) error {
    if err := smtp.SendMail(config); err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to send email: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
