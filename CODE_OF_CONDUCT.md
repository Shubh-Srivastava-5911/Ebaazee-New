We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

- Be respectful and considerate.
- Do not harass or insult others.
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
- Focus on what is best for the community.

## Enforcement
